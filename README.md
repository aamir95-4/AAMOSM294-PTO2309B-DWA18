To fill read me with instructions on navigating, where to find user stories implementation, improvements that can be made and netlify link for app.
Go through all files and add comments.

Possible Improvements:

- Linking app to a live API to fetch the latest podcasts
- Implementing avatar functionality and profile updates with users name and personalised avatar. Began building functionality but not complete.
- Profile overlay is not complete.
- When begining my project I did not plan before jumping right in, even though the app works, I think I could have structured it better.
