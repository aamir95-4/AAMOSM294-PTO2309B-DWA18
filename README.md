# UAVVE Podcast app - Codespace Capstone Project

## Introduction

The final project in the Codespace Javascript course. Tasked with building a podcast app from a list of user stories.

## User stories and implementation

Project is deployed to a custom Netlify URL

✅ All views in the app display correctly on the smallest mobile device available, “iPhone SE”. This can be emulated in Chrome Dev tools.

✅ All favicon information has been created an added correctly via https://realfavicongenerator.net/ (you are welcome to use any free PNG image you find on https://www.flaticon.com/)

✅ All metatag information has been created and added via https://metatags.io/ (You are welcome to use any free image on https://unsplash.com/). Be mindful to manually replace all URL values (especially image URL) to absolute Netlify URL values (you will need to deploy to Netlify first)

✅ All show data loaded via a fetch call from the https://podcast-api.netlify.app/shows

✅ When viewing a specific show, data is loaded via fetch from individual show endpoint

✅ There is a loading state while initial data is being loaded

✅ There is a loading state while new data is being loaded

✅ User can "reset" all their progress, effectively removing their listening history

✅ User is presented with a sliding carousel of possible shows they might be interested in on the landing page

✅ User can log in via https://app.supabase.com authentication

✅ User favourites are stored in the https://app.supabase.com database

✅ User favourites are automatically synced when logged in, ensuring that they share favourites between devices

✅ Users can share their favourites as a publicly accessible URL

## Possible Improvements:

- Linking app to a live API to fetch the latest podcasts
- Implementing avatar functionality and profile updates with users name and personalised avatar. Began building functionality but not complete.
- Profile overlay is not complete.
- When begining my project I did not plan before jumping right in, even though the app works, I think I could have structured it better.
